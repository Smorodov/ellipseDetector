## Overview
This is a try to port MATLAB ellipse detector project to cpp.

Project based on https://github.com/AlanLuSun/High-quality-ellipse-detection repository.

Seems it works well now, but It still need to check carefully.

## Prerequisites (which I used)

- OS
  Windows 10
  MSVS 2019 

- Packages
0. OpenCV 4.x   
1. [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 
2. Eigen
3. MATLAB (if you want matlab binding)
